  * Item-Item Nearest Neighbour models using Cosine, TFIDF or BM25 as a distance metric.
 All models have multi-threaded training routines, using Cython and OpenMP to fit the models in
parallel among all available CPU cores.  In addition, the ALS and BPR models both have custom CUDA
kernels - enabling fitting on compatible GPU's. Approximate nearest neighbours libraries such as [Annoy](https://github.com/spotify/annoy), [NMSLIB](https://github.com/searchivarius/nmslib)
and [Faiss](https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss) can also be used by Implicit to [speed up making recommendations](http://www.benfrederickson.com/approximate-nearest-neighbours-for-recommender-systems/).

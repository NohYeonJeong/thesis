 The recommendation system is a system that suggests contents with high preference by filtering according to the user's taste. As the amount of information increases at an exponential rate due to popularization of smart devices and activation of mobile services, there is an increasing need for an information recommendation system. Various researches have been carried out to utilize this effectively, but users still have a lot of difficulties in finding the content they want from among many multimedia contents.
 The collaborative filtering method, which is most commonly used in the movie recommendation system, has the advantage of high recommendation accuracy. However, there is a problem of cold start that recommendation accuracy is low when the user does not have enough information on the evaluation score of the movie.

In this thesis, I will examine the current status of recommendation services through Quantum Theory recommendation techniques of  Netflix, which is an online movie streaming company. For more exact recommendation system, I propose a method of applying context-based information to collaborative filtering techniques. In addition, I suggest the direction of recommendation system through the limitation of collaborative filtering recommendation system described above. As I study these topics, describe my progress in this repository on behalf of my research notes.

 What is Collaborative Filtering:
Collaborative Filtering is a method of making automatic predictions (filtering) about the interests of a user by collecting preferences or taste information from similar users.
